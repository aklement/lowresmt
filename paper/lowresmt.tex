\section{Introduction} \label{sect:intro}

The parameters of statistical models of translation are typically estimated from large bilingual parallel corpora \cite{Brown:1993}.  However, these resources are not available for most language pairs and they are expensive to produce in quantities sufficient for building a good translation system.  In this work, we take an entirely different approach: we use cheap and plentiful monolingual resources to induce an end-to-end statistical machine translation system.  In particular, we extend the long line of work on inducing translation lexicons (beginning with \newcite{Rapp:1995}) and propose to use multiple independent cues present in cheap and plentiful monolingual texts to estimate lexical and phrasal translation probabilities for large MT scale phrase-tables.  We then introduce a novel algorithm to estimate reordering features from monolingual data alone, and report the performance of a phrase-based statistical model \cite{Koehn:2003} estimated on these monolingual features.

Most of the prior work on lexicon induction is motivated by the idea that it could be applied to machine translation but stops short of actually doing so.  Lexicon induction holds the potential to create machine translation systems for languages which do not have extensive parallel corpora.  Instead training would only require two large monolingual corpora and a small bilingual dictionary, if one is available.  The idea is that intrinsic properties of monolingual data (possibly, along with a handful of bilingual pairs to act as example mappings) can provide independent but informative cues to learn translations, because words (and phrases) behave similarly across languages.  This work is the first attempt to extend and apply these ideas to an end-to-end machine translation pipeline.  While we make an explicit assumption that a table of phrasal translations is given a priori, we induce every other parameter of a full phrase-based translation system from monolingual data alone.  The contributions of this work are:

\section{Related Work} \label{sect:related-work}

Statistical machine translation (SMT) was first formulated by~\newcite{Brown:1993} at IBM, who proposed a series of probabilistic models based on word-to-word correspondences.  The best performing current methods, so-called {\em phrase-based} and {\em hierarchical} models \cite{Och:2002,Koehn:2003,Chiang:2005} build on the IBM models, treating multi-token phrases as building blocks for producing new translations.  Their parameters are estimated from large quantities of sentence aligned translations.
These parallel resources are only available for a small set of language pairs and are very expensive to compile in sufficient quantities.  
In this work, we estimate the parameters of the phrase-based formalism (reviewed in \secref{sect:bckg:smt}) from {\em monolingual} texts, which are much more plentiful. \nocite{Munteanu:2006,Smith2010,Uszkoreit:2010}

Our methods for estimating model parameters build on the long line of work in bilingual lexicon induction from monolingual corpora. \newcite{Rapp:1995} was the first to propose using the context of a given word as a clue to its translation.  The model populates a bilingual lexicon by using a small seed dictionary to project context vectors across two languages and to score their similarity. \newcite{Rapp:1999}, and \newcite{Fung:1998} build on the original idea proposing alternative similarity metrics. \newcite{Schafer:2002} exploited the idea that word translations tend to co-occur in time across languages. \newcite{Klementiev:2006b} used this temporal cue to train a phonetic similarity model for associating Named Entities across languages.  \newcite{Koehn:2002} used similarity in spelling as another kind of cue that a pair of words may be translations of one another.  In this work, we extend these ideas and utilize three independent metrics to score {\em phrasal} translation candidates.  More recent work on lexical induction includes \newcite{Haghighi:2008} who made use of contextual and orthographic clues to learn a generative model from monolingual texts and a seed lexicon.  \newcite{Mimno:2009}  proposed a polylingual topic model and matched high probability words in each topic across languages.  While effective for a small number of topics, it is unlikely to scale well to large multilingual dictionaries. \newcite{BergKirkpatrick2011} learn a correspondence between the alphabets of two languages for cognate identification, which will not generalize to general etymologically unrelated translations. 

%\todop{Chris}{Additional reference pointed out by reviewers worth including?}
\newcite{Carbonell2006} described a data-driven machine translation system that used no parallel text. It produced translation lattices using a bilingual dictionary and scored them using an n-gram language model.  This method is similar to our baseline which eliminates the translation probabilities from a phrase-table, and scores the output only with an n-gram language model.  

We examine scenarios where large bilingual parallel corpora are not available.  A variety of past research has focused on overcoming this bottleneck by mining parallel or comparable corpora from the web \cite{Munteanu:2006,Schwenk2008,Rauf2009,Smith2010,Uszkoreit:2010}.  Methods for acquiring bitexts are complimentary but orthogonal to our research goals.  We focus on the ``no bitext'' condition, but a logical follow-on would be to bootstrap from a small bitext.

\section{Background} \label{sect:bckg}
\subsection{Parameters of phrase-based SMT} \label{sect:bckg:smt}

We attempt to use monolingual texts and an incomplete bilingual dictionary to estimate the parameters of a phrase-based translation  model \cite{Koehn:2003,Moses}.  Phrase-based translation typically starts by word-aligning a bilingual parallel corpus \cite{Och2003}.  The Viterbi word alignments determine the parameters of phrase-based SMT.  These parameters are:

\begin{figure}[t]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{../figures/reorderfeats/reorderfeats.pdf}
\caption{Example alignment with three kinds of orientations: monotone (m), swap (s), and discontinuous (d). }
\label{fig:reorderfeats} 
\end{center}
%\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

\begin{my_itemize}
\item \emph{Phrase pairs}.  
Phrase extraction heuristics \cite{Venugopal2003,Tillmann2003,Och2004} produce a set of phrase pairs $(e, f)$ that are consistent with the word alignments.  We consider the inventory of phrase pairs (irrespective of their scores) to be a model parameter.  %Creating this inventory from monolingual texts alone is a major challenge, and we leave it for future work.

\item \emph{Phrase translation probabilities}.  Each phrase pair has a list of associated feature functions (FFs).  These include phrase translation probabilities ${\phi(e|f)}$ and ${\phi(f|e)}$ which are  typically calculated via maximum likelihood estimation. 

\item \emph{Lexical weighting}.  Since MLE overestimates ${\phi}$ for phrase pairs with sparse counts, lexical weighting FFs are used to smooth.  Average word translation probabilities ${w(e_i|f_j)}$ are calculated via phrase-pair-internal word alignments.

\item \emph{Reordering model}.  Each $(e, f)$ also has reordering parameters $p_o(\textnormal{orientation}|f,e)$ which indicate the distribution of its orientation wrt the previously translated phrase. Orientations are {\it monotone, swap, discontinuous} \cite{tillman:2004:HLTNAACL,Kumar2004}, see \figref{fig:reorderfeats}. 

\item \emph{Other features}. Other typical features are n-gram language model scores and phrase penalty (which governs whether to use fewer longer phrases or more shorter phrases).  These are not bilingually estimated, so we can re-use them directly without modification. 
\end{my_itemize}

\noindent
The features are combined in a log linear model, and their weights are set through minimum error rate training \cite{Och2003c}.
%Log linear formulation:
%  \begin{eqnarray*}
 %   p(\mathbf{e} | \mathbf{f}) & \propto & \exp \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\lambda_i h_i (\mathbf{e}, \mathbf{f})} \label{log-linear-formulation}\\
 %   \hat{e} & = & \argmax_{e}{p(\mathbf{e} | \mathbf{f}) }
 % \end{eqnarray*}
We use the same log linear formulation and MERT but propose alternatives derived directly from monolingual data for all parameters except for the phrase pairs themselves.\footnote{We \emph{do} require a small bitext of approximately 1,000 sentences to use as a development set for parameter tuning.}

\subsection{Bilingual lexicon induction for SMT} \label{sect:bckg:lexind}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Accuracy of top 1 and top 10 single-word translations induced using contextual similarity (defined in \secref{sect:phrasalfeats}) from the unaligned monolingual English and Spanish sections of the Europarl corpus as a function of the source word corpus frequency.

\label{fig:lexinduct}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

There are inherent challenges in applying lexicon induction methods to statistical machine translation.  Scaling these methods up to MT sized bilingual dictionaries substantially degrades their performance due to sparsity issues. High accuracy results reported in most of the previous literature on a small set of source language words (e.g. 100 nouns in \newcite{Rapp:1995}, 1,000 most frequent words in \newcite{Koehn:2002}, or 2,000 most frequent nouns in \newcite{Haghighi:2008}) tend to be misleading when the goal is to induce large translation dictionaries. \figref{fig:lexinduct} plots the quality of single-word translations induced using contextual similarity (defined in \secref{sect:phrasalfeats}) from the unaligned monolingual English and Spanish sections of the Europarl corpus\footnote{\secref{sect:expsetup} describes the data and parameters in detail.} as a function of source word corpus frequency. Unsurprisingly, frequent terms have a substantially better chance of being paired with a correct translation.  These concerns are exacerbated when we move to multi-token phrases.  As with phrase translation features estimated from parallel data, longer phrases are more sparse, making similarity scores less reliable than for single words. 

In this work, we make an explicit assumption that a set of phrase pairs is given a priori, and extend lexicon induction methods to estimate their phrase and lexical translation probabilities.  Sparsity is a major concern when scoring MT sized phrase tables, and we propose to deal with in two ways.  First, in \secref{sect:phrasalfeats} we propose to use multiple cues intrinsic to monolingual data as independent evidence when scoring translation candidates.  Second,  in \secref{sect:lexfeats}, we introduce additional similarity estimates less prone to phrasal sparsity issues.

%In \secref{sect:exp:lesions} we show that monolingual features are very informative and reliable in our setting; even when added alongside the feature functions derived from parallel data, they yield substantial BLEU score improvements (over a point in our Spanish-English MT experiments).

%Second, extending the bilingual lexicon induction methods to the induction of multi-word translation pairs greatly increases computational cost. Since each source-target pair must be scored, we would need to compute $|V_{f}| * |V_{e}|$ similarity scores, where $|V_{f}|$ and $|V_{e}|$ are the number of unique items in the source and target vocabularies. When we move from tokens to multi word phrases, $|V|$ grows to the number of unique {\it n}-grams. Exhaustively scoring all phrase pairs up to length three, for example, requires computing scores between the set of unique unigrams, bigrams and trigrams in the source and target languages.  In \secref{sect:extract}, we propose methods to substantially reduce the number of comparisons, while keeping good translation candidates.

%By comparison, \newcite{Rapp:1999} originally evaluated his bilingual lexicon induction only on a collection of 100 manually selected German nouns.  For computational reasons, the number of vector comparisons was reduced by comparing these nouns only against English words with a frequency $\geq100$ in the monolingual corpus.
% Rapp reports that his English monolingual corpus has 657,787 word types after lemmatization, but does not report how many remain after thresholding.
%\newcite{Koehn:2002} used a test set consisting of the 1000 most frequent nouns from a German-English lexicon.  They performed only one million vector comparisons between the 1000 most frequent German nouns and the 1000 most frequent English nouns.
%\newcite{Haghighi:2008} learn translations for only the 2000 most frequent nouns.   \newcite{Garera2009} expand beyond nouns to any part of speech, but still only extract translations of the 1000 most frequent words.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Phrase scoring} \label{sect:score}

In place of phrase scores estimated from bilingual alignments, we propose to make use of cues present in monolingual data to provide multiple orthogonal estimates of similarity between a pair of phrases. In this section, we introduce two kinds of scores we call {\em phrasal} and {\em lexical similarity} features.  The former score entire phrases, while the latter use word-level alignments between the phrase pairs to calculate lexical level scores.  The motivation is analogous to the two kinds of features we introduced in \secref{sect:bckg:smt}: lexical similarity features are informative for rare phrases that have less reliable phrasal similarity scores because of sparse counts. 
%These behave analogously to the phrasal and lexical features in \secref{sect:bckg:smt}.

\subsubsection{Phrasal similarity features} \label{sect:phrasalfeats}

\paraheader{Contextual similarity.}  We extend the vector space approach of \newcite{Rapp:1999} to compute similarity between \emph{phrases} in the source and target languages.  More formally, assume that $(s_{1}, s_{2}, \dots s_{N})$ and $(t_{1}, t_{2}, \dots t_{M})$ are (arbitrarily indexed) source and target vocabularies, respectively.  A source phrase $f$ is represented with an $N$ and target phrase $e$ with an $M$ dimensional vector (see \figref{fig:contextual}).  Only the components corresponding to words that appear in the context of a phrase in data take on non-zero values. Next, $f$'s contextual vector is projected by mapping its components to the target language space using the small number of word-word translations taken from a seed dictionary.
%, but retaining the source component value.  
Finally, the pair ($f, e$) is scored by computing similarity between the target  and projected source vectors.  Various means of computing the component values and vector similarity measures have been proposed in literature (e.g. \newcite{Rapp:1999}, \newcite{Fung:1998}).  Following \newcite{Fung:1998}, we compute the value of the $k$-th component of $f$'s contextual vector  as follows: 
\begin{equation*}
w_{k} = n_{f,k} \times (log( {n / n_{k}}) + 1)
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $n_{f,k}$ and $n_{k}$ are the number of times $s_{k}$ appears in the context of $f$ and in the entire corpus, and $n$ is the maximum number of occurrences of any word in the data.  Intuitively, the more frequently $s_{k}$ appears with $f$ and the less common it is in the corpus in general, the higher its component value.  Similarity between two resulting vectors is measured as a cosine of the angle between them.

%\mtodo{Give an example Spanish phrase and the English phrases that it has the highest similarity with}

\paraheader{Temporal similarity.} In addition to contextual similarity, phrases in two different languages may be scored in terms of their temporal similarity \cite{alfonseca-ciaramita-hall:2009:EMNLP}.  The intuition is that news stories from different countries will tend to discuss the same world events on the same day.  The frequencies of phrases over time give them a particular signature that will tend to spike on the same dates across languages.  For instance, if the phrase {\it asian tsunami} is used frequently during a particular time span, the number of mentions of the Spanish phrase {\it maremoto asi\'{a}tico} is very likely to increase in the same timeframe. \figref{fig:temporal} illustrates how the temporal distribution of {\it to terrorists} is more similar to the Spanish {\it a los terroristas} than to other Spanish phrases.  Such temporal similarity between a pair of phrases provides another weak signal we can use to score them.   To generate the signature for a given phrase, we first sort the set of (time-stamped) documents of our corpus into a sequence of equally sized temporal bins and count the number of phrase occurrences in each bin.   Following \newcite{Klementiev:2006b}, we then use the cosine distance between a pair of normalized temporal signatures to score the corresponding phrase pair.

%\mtodo{Give a couple of examples of phrase pairs that have high temporal similarity.  Possibly using the same example as for the contextual similarity.}

%\mtodo{integrate citations to these two papers in this section: 
%"lexical relationships from temporal patterns"
%\cite{alfonseca-ciaramita-hall:2009:EMNLP}
%Also
%\cite{Schafer:2002}}

\paraheader{Topic similarity.}\mtodo{Spin this as a new feature!}  Phrases and their translations are likely to appear in articles written about the same topic in two languages.  Thus, topic or category information associated with monolingual data can also be used to indicate similarity between a phrase and its candidate translation.  In order to score a pair of phrases, we can collect their topic signatures by counting their occurrences in each topic and then comparing the resulting vectors.  We again use the cosine similarity measure on the normalized topic signatures.  In our experiments, we use interlingual links between wikipedia articles to estimate topic similarity.  That is, we treat each linked article pair as a topic and collect counts for each phrase across all articles in its corresponding language.

\subsubsection{Lexical similarity features}  \label{sect:lexfeats}

\paraheader{Contextual, Temporal and Topic similarity.}  Another way to estimate the quality of a phrasal translation is to score the similarity of individual words within the phrases.  To compute these lexical similarity features, we first average similarity scores (contextual or temporal) over all aligned words across the two phrases.  We then scale the score by the proportion of aligned words in the two phrases, effectively penalizing poorly aligned phrase pairs. Because individual words are more frequent than multiword phrases, the accuracy of their induced translations tends to be higher (see Figure \ref{fig:lexinduct}). Combining the phrasal and lexical features results in better translation quality than phrasal features alone. \mtodo{Mention that it is the average of both forward and backward alignments?}

\paraheader{Orthographic / phonetic similarity.} Etymologically related words often retain similar spelling across languages with the same writing system, and edit distance can be used to measure their similarity.  We use word alignments as before to score entire phrases for orthographic similarity.\mtodo{Not done quite the same as above but will glance over it.} We can also extend this idea to language pairs not sharing the same writing system since many cognates, borrowed words, and names remain phonetically similar.  Transliterations can be generated for tokens in a source phrase (e.g. \cite{Knight1997}), with phonetic similarity computed as before.

Various other similarity scores can be computed depending on the available monolingual data and its associated metadata (see, e.g. \newcite{Schafer:2002}). All of these can be incorporated into our log linear translation model as additional feature functions.

%\skipheader In our experiments in \secref{sect:exp}, we will focus on the similarity scores introduced in this section.  However, note that various other similarity scores\mtodo{list them} can be computed depending on the available monolingual data and its associated metadata (see, e.g. \newcite{Schafer:2002}).

  \caption{Estimating orientation scores from monolingual data.} \label{fig:algoreorder}
  \vskip -0.2in
\end{algorithm}

In the phrase-based SMT pipeline, phrase pair orientation statistics are collected using word alignments.  We keep a similar reordering model formulation but infer its parameters from monolingual data instead.  The orientation information for a phrase pair ($f$, $e$) is collected from source and target sentences containing ($f$, $e$) as well as other phrase pairs.  Suppose one such sentence pair contains another pair of phrases ($f'$, $e'$), and that $f'$ is immediately adjacent to $f$.  The idea is to check whether $e'$ stays in the same order with $e$, swaps, or becomes discontinuous in the target sentence. Consider the simple example in \figref{fig:monoreord}: the phrase pair is ($f =$ \emq{profile}, $e =$ \emq{Profils}), and a given pair of non-parallel sentences also contains a phrase table entry ($f' =$ \emq{Facebook}, $e' =$ \emq{in Facebook}).  In this example, the phrase $f'$ preceding $f$ in the source sentence swaps order with $e$ in the target.  When we collect these counts over large monolingual corpora, we expect the swap, monotone, and discontinuous counts to provide good estimates for the orientation features (\figref{fig:algoreorder}).
%Note that multiple phrases may immediately precede $f$ and appear in the phrase table; however, we only use the longest of them to collect reordering counts.  
Shorter and more frequent phrases (e.g. punctuation) are more likely to appear in multiple orientations with a given phrase.  Thus, we (a) collect the longest contextual phrases (which also appear in the phrase table) for reordering feature estimation, and (b) only keep a relatively small set of least frequent contextual phrases we do collect\footnote{The pruning step has an additional benefit of minimizing the memory needed for orientation feature estimations.}

The algorithm in \figref{fig:algoreorder} estimates monotone, swap, and discontinuous orientation features ($p_m$, $p_s$, $p_d$) for a phrase pair ($f, e$).  It begins by calling {\tt \small CollectOccurs} to collect the longest matching phrase table phrases preceding $f$ in source monolingual data ($B_f$), as well as preceding ($B_e$), following ($A_e$), and discontinuous ($D_e$) phrases with $e$ in the target language data.  For each unique phrase $f'$ preceding $f$, translations are then looked up in the phrase table $\emph{T}$.  Next, we count\footnote{$\#_{L}(x)$ returns the count of object x in list L.} how many translations $e'$ of $'$ appeared before, after or were discontinuous with $e$ in the target language data.  Finally, the counts are normalized and returned.  %The algorithm requires a single pass through the data to collect contextual phrases for the entire phrase table and its running time is quadratic in the size of the table.\mtodo{Check}

%\subsection{Extracting a phrase table without a bitext}  \label{sect:extract}
%Where do we get the phrase table if we cannot extract it from word-aligned sentence pairs? We propose three methods: (1) We implement several ways to prune the space of phrase pair comparisons, which allow us to extend past efforts in bilingual lexicon induction from monolingual corpora to multi-word phrases. (2) We build a table of phrase pair translations by composing phrases using an existing bilingual seed dictionary. (3) We identify \emph {unigrams} in our development and test sets that are OOV in our existing bilingual dictionary and then use a bilingual lexicon induction framework to induce new translations for each. In Section \ref{sect:exp:pt} we perform end-to-end MT experiments to test the quality of these phrase tables both individually and combined.

%\paraheader{Phrase table induction.} As we argued in \secref{sect:bckg:lexind}, we cannot na\"{i}vely extend translation lexicon induction techniques to induce phrasal translations because the search space is too large. We must aggressively prune it.   Specifically, we compare phrases in the same frequency bands \cite{Uszkoreit:2010}, disallow unigram-trigram pairs, and prune very low frequency target phrases. We also use a filter that requires stemmed versions of each phrase-pair to contain at least one (source unigrams and bigrams) or two (source trigrams) word-pairs from a stemmed version of our bilingual dictionary.\footnote{Our stemmer truncates words to a max. of six characters.} %\todo{Alt wording:} We compare  each source side phrase only to target side phrases that occur in the same frequency band (according to the frequencies in two monolingual corpora). Of those target side phrases, we keep only the ones with at least one \mtodo{discuss dictionary parameters} word translating into a word in the source side phrase. 

%To determine whether our pruning parameters are reasonable, we evaluate what percent of the items from a bilingually induced phrase table are retained.  Rather than consider all items from the phrase table (since many of them are bad), we consider only those phrase-pairs that are used by the decoder to translate a test set.\footnote{We use the Moses decoder's trace function to find the set of phrases it used in decoding our test set.} We compare our filtered phrase tables to this set of phrase translation rules and attempt to maintain as many of them as possible, while pruning the set of phrase pairs down to a manageable size. Table \ref{table:prune} shows results using the enumerated heuristics both with the dictionary filter (``Freq+Dict'') and without (``Freq Filter'').

%\paraheader{Dictionary-based phrase table.} We build a second phrase table by enumerating all combinations and permutations of up to three source word dictionary translations \cite{garera08a}. %CUT FOR SPACE Our Spanish--English dictionary has entries for 49,795 source tokens and the resulting phrase table has a large amount of overlap with the decoder table, as shown in Table \ref{table:prune} (``Dict combs''). 
%CUT FOR SPACE: However, for the case of low-resource languages, dictionaries, in the cases that they even exist, are not as complete. We expect the performance of our dictionary-based phrase table to be an upper bound for the performance of an induced-dictionary-composed table for truly low-resource languages.

%\paraheader{Induced lexical translations.} We use a bilingual lexical induction framework that compares context, time, and edit distance source and target word vectors to build a table of candidate translations for the word types (approximately 10,000 for Spanish) in our development and test sets that do not have entries in our bilingual dictionary. In Section \ref{sect:exp:pt} we use this relatively small set of unigram translation pairs to supplement the above tables.
%approximately 3k for Urdu: took out because PT experiments section doesn't have Urdu results

%Our baseline phrase table is generated using a bilingual dictionary. For each Urdu test set phrase up to length three, we generated English phrases from all combinations of dictionary translations and all possible reorderings.

\section{Experimental Setup} \label{sect:expsetup}

In our experimental setup, we use a fixed set of phrase translation pairs that is extracted from a bitext, but we estimate all other parameters using from monolingual data alone. 

In the first set of experiments using monolingual features, we treat the two sides of our bitext as independent, monolingual corpora. That is, we throw away sentence alignments and then estimate the features based on corpora which we know have very similar phrasal and temporal monolingual distributions.  Our goal is to get a sense for how much lost performance we can hope to regain from monolingual features in this idealized setup.  In the second set of experiments, we throw away this idealization and estimate the features from truly monolingual corpora. In both cases, we explore the relative contribution of different types of features. Both sets of experiments assume that a high quality phrase table is given. This assumption enables us to test the quality of our monolingual features directly. In future work, we will explore inducing the phrase table itself without using a large bitext.
%For the second set of experiments, we give up the idealized phrase table. For the third set, we drop the second idealization and show how well we do using truly monolingual texts.

\paraheader{Data.} In Section \ref{sect:results}, we present results on Spanish-English MT. 
%
Our first set of experiments treats the Spanish and English sections of the Europarl v5 corpus\cite{Koehn:2005} as two independent, monolingual corpora. We estimate contextual, temporal\footnote{Europarl filenames include dates, making temporal signatures easy to compute.}, and reordering features using this idealized data setup for the given phrase table. 
%
Then, in the second set of experiments, we estimate the features using truly independent corpora. We estimate contextual and temporal monolingual features using a sample of the Spanish and English Gigaword corpora\footnote{We use the entirety of the following English and Spanish Gigaword sections: Agence France-Presse (afp), Associated Press Worldstream (apw), and Xinhua News Agency (xin).}, and we estimate monolingual topic similarity and an additional contextual feature using a sample of the set of English and Spanish Wikipedia articles that contain interlingual links to one another\footnote{We use a subset of about 60,000 paired, interlingually linked pages.}. We also estimate our monolingual reordering features using the Wikipedia data.\mtodo{Really?} 
%For Urdu-English (ur-en) experiments in \secref{sect:exp:indep} we use the parallel corpus and development and test sets distributed for the NIST 2009 Open MT Evaluation Workshop.  We estimate monolingual parameters from genuinely monolingual Urdu and English corpora annotated with publication dates (145 and 159 million tokens, respectively), which we have collected by crawling online news sites.  %Note: we have been collecting similar resources for a number of low density languages, and we plan to make them available to the community.  
%Our seed dictionary has entries for 25,377 source tokens.
%
In addition to the given phrase table, the only bilingual resources that we use are a seed dictionary containing entries for 49,795 source tokens\footnote{End-to-end translation results are robust to substantially reducing dictionary size; we omit the experiments due to space constraints.} and a development set comprised of {\em news-test2008} and {\em news-syscomb2009} \cite{callisonburch-EtAl:2010:WMT} to tune feature weights in minimum error rate training. Note though that the development bitext is very small (2,553 sentences).
%However, these bitexts are very small (2,553 and 981 sentences for es-en and ur-en, respectively).  

\paraheader{Software.} We use the Moses SMT toolkit \cite{Moses} and a language model trained on the English side of the parallel corporus.  With the exception of maximum phrase length (set to 3 in our experiments), default values were used for all of the parameters.  We collect contextual vectors for phrases over windows of two tokens on each side. %CUT FOR SPACE (provided it does not cross the sentence boundary).   
We also prune the preceding, following, and discontinues phrases collected by {\tt \small CollectOccurs} (see \figref{fig:algoreorder}) to contain at most 1,000, 1,000, and 3,000 least frequent phrases phrases, respectively.

%Since our experiments are complex, we release our software for full reproducibility.  It includes source code and documentation describing the monolingual estimation proceedures for all parameters. We include large monolingual corpora and dictionaries for 55 low density languages. \url{url}


%We begin with a series of lesion experiments in which we drop feature functions estimated from parallel data.  %We then add equivalent but monolingually estimated features in reverse order to see how much of the lost performance can be regained.  \figref{fig:lesionreplacement} gives all of the results, which are explained below. Finally, we move on to phrase table induction experiments.

\section{Results} \label{sect:results}

First, we remove each of the standard bilingually estimated features from the SMT model in order to understand their relative contributions to the performance of the end-to-end system (Section \ref{sect:exp:lesions}). Then, in Section \ref{sec:results:bitext}, we replace them with monolingual features estimated using the Europarl training corpus but treating each side as an independent, monolingual corpus (i.e., throwing away sentence alignments). In Section \ref{sec:results:mono}, we estimate the features using truly monolingual corpora.

\subsection{Lesion experiments (Experiments 1-4)}\label{sect:exp:lesions}
%\paragraph{Lesion experiments (Experiments 1-4)}

We begin with a series of experiments where we remove individual features derived from an aligned bitext in order to get a sense of their relative contributions to the overall system performance on the English-Spanish language pair (see \figref{fig:lesionreplacement}). When both phrase and orientation features are derived from word alignments ({\bf B/B}, the standard features functions defined in \secref{sect:bckg:smt}), the system reaches 21.87 BLEU.  Next we replace orientation features with random values ({\bf B/--}) and drop phrase features ({\bf --/B}).  While phrase table features account for a substantial performance difference (9 BLEU points), dropping orientation features affects the system score relatively little.  This is not surprising, since the word order is generally preserved in Spanish to English translations.  Finally, both dropping phrase scores and replacing orientation features with random values ({\bf --/--}) results in 5.5 BLEU, a 16.4 point drop.  This is equivalent to the only prior art on end-to-end MT without parallel data \cite{Carbonell2006}, which scores translation with a language model alone.

\subsection{Adding equivalent monolingual features estimated using the {\em bitext} (Experiments 5-10)}\label{sec:results:bitext}

Next, we replace the feature functions with their monolingual equivalents estimated using the two sides of the bitext, hoping to regain much of the 16.4 BLEU point loss that resulted from dropping all features.  Adding orientation features estimated from monolingual data alone ({\bf --/M})  recovers 5 BLEU points. Adding contextual, temporal, and orthographic features recover over 11 BLEU points together ({\bf M/--}).
%Adding phrasal monolingual scores ({\bf P/--}) and lexical monolingual scores ({\bf L/--}) separately recover 8.8 and 10.8 BLEU points, respectively, and 11.3 points together. 
Like the standard translation features estimated from the bitext, our monolingual features contribute more to performance than the reordering feature. Supplementing the stripped phrase table with all of our monolingually estimated features ({\bf M/M}) yields an even higher gain of {\bf 12.0 BLEU} points. %, or {\bf over 80\% of the BLEU score} loss that occurred when we dropped all features from the phrase table. 
Our monolingual features successfully recover much of the information contained in the features derived from bitext.  %Note that the achieved score is equivalent to a standard bilingually estimated system trained on a parallel corpus of roughly 500,000 \todo{is this still the same?} words (learning curve is omitted due to space constraints).
However, here we use monolingual corpora which we know to have equal phrasal and temporal distributions. In the next section, we drop this idealization.
\todo{Add Europarl by-feature-type results}


\subsection{Adding equivalent monolingual features estimated using {\em truly monolingual} corpora (Experiments 12-18)}\label{sec:results:mono}

Finally, instead of treating two sides of the parallel corpus as independent, monolingual corpora, we estimate our features using truly monolingual corpora. As explained in Section \ref{sect:expsetup}, we estimate contextual and temporal features using subsets of the Spanish and English Gigaword corpora, and we estimate an additional contextual feature, the topical feature, and reordering features using a sample of Spanish and English Wikipedia pages. Adding orientation features alone ({\bf --/M}) recovers 4.7 BLEU points, about 0.3 less than adding orientation features estimated using the bitext. Experiments 13-16 show how each monolingually estimated feature impacts MT performance. Each feature is independently capable of recovering at least 7.5 BLEU points above the featureless table. The topical feature is the most independently informative and alone recovers over 11 BLEU points. Together, the four monolingually estimated features ({\bf M/-}) recover over 12.5 points and result in a BLEU score of 18.06. Also using our monolingually estimated reordering feature ({\bf M/M}) yields a total gain of {\bf 13.3 BLEU} points, or {\bf over 80\% of the BLEU score} loss that occurred when we dropped all features from the phrase table. As Figure \ref{fig:mtlearn} shows, this achieved score is equivalent to a standard bilingually estimated system trained on a parallel corpus of roughly 60,000 parallel sentences. %(learning curve is omitted due to space constraints).

\begin{figure}[t]

\label{fig:mtlearn}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}


%However, the phrasal and lexical scores are {\em better} than those estimated using the Europarl bitext; adding them to the stripped phrase table further increases the BLEU score by 1.2 and 0.5 points, respectively, and 1.3 together, {\em beyond} the scores achieved when adding the features estimated using the bitext. This additional gain is likely due to the fact that our monolingual corpora are large relative to the bitext and that we are able to capture a strong orthogonal topical similarity signal. Supplementing the stripped phrase table with all of our features estimated from truly monolingual corpora ({\bf PL/M}) yields a total gain of {\bf 13.3 BLEU} points, or {\bf over 80\% of the BLEU score} loss that occurred when we dropped all features from the phrase table. Note that the achieved score is equivalent to a standard bilingually estimated system trained on a parallel corpus of roughly 500,000 \todo{is this still the same?} words (learning curve is omitted due to space constraints).

\subsection{Augmenting standard features with monolingual features (Experiment 11, 19)}
We perform an additional experiment to determine whether there is any information estimated in monolingual scores that is not captured by the standard feature set derived from the bitext. Indeed, we see a 1.0 BLEU point increase when we supplement the original phrase table with the monolingual phrasal and lexical features estimated using the bitext and 1.5 BLEU point increase using those estimated from our truly monolingual corpora ({\bf BPL/B}). Therefore, our monolingually estimated scores capture some novel information not contained in the standard feature set. 

\section{Discussion}
Maybe add a section to interpret the by-feature-type results and compare the effectiveness of estimates from Europarl with the estimates from the truly monolingual corpora. Could comment on how topical feature wasn't possible with Europarl data, and how signals may be stronger for truly monolingual corpora because they're so much larger. Also could comment on the domain of the test set and how using out-of-domain Europarl to estimate monolingual features may not be best; our approaches do some domain adaptation. This would be a nice section to have in addition to 6, and with it we could probably make 6 shorter.

While we cannot recover as much of the lost performance (see \figref{fig:urdu}) as we did in the idealized setup of the Spanish-English experiments, the monolingual features take us a long way toward inducing a reasonable model.  We show that it is possible to estimate features using \emph{completely independent monolingual corpora}.% brings us to within 7 BLEU points of the standard bilingually estimated model. %Monolingual corpora are more plentiful than parallel data, and we expect system performance to improve further with more available data.

\section{Summary and Future Work} \label{sect:conc}

%In the future we plan to build complete systems for low resource languages. In the case that very little or no parallel text is available, we expect to significantly outperform state-of-the-art MT. We have been actively collecting newswire data for many languages, which we will use to build phrase tables and estimate monolingual features, and we will make this available to the research community.

%In moving from Spanish--English translation to translation from other, less-similar languages, we expect to face new challenges. Estimating orientation probabilities, for example, for languages with very different grammars may demand a more sophisticated algorithm. However, our work here lays the foundation for this important future work.

In this work, we use abundant monolingual data to induce a full end-to-end machine translation system, reducing the dependence on the expensive and scarce parallel texts required by state-of-the-art SMT. % We demonstrate empirically that monolingual data can get us a long way toward high quality machine translation. 
Specifically, we define monolingual equivalents of the phrase-based translation model parameters and demonstrate that they are capable of recovering over 80\% of the performance of the standard phrase based machine translation system.  %Next, we propose several methods to induce a phrase table and show that the resulting end-to-end system significantly improves over the sole comparable past approach.  Finally, we show that monolingual data takes us a long way toward inducing a good translation model for a true low-resource language (Urdu).

%This work presents a promising direction for reducing the expensive and sparse parallel data that is assumed by state-of-the-art SMT.  
%It remains to be seen if increasing the amount of monolingual data that we use will afford continuous improvements, or if we need a more complex translation model. 

There are many interesting questions and directions for future work.  First, we plan to develop methods for inducing a phrase table, which we assumed in this work. Additionally, utilizing small bitexts in combination with our monolingual parameter estimation techniques is a realistic resource condition and may improve performance further. We will investigate the relative value of bilingual and monolingual texts. We will also explore using richer feature sets and more principled methods for constructing the phrase table. For example, when extracting phrase tables, rather than heuristically pruning the space of possible phrase pairs before scoring them, we will use approximate scoring techniques, such as Locality Sensitive Hashing \cite{Charikar2002,VanDurme2010} in order to consider a large space of potential phrase pairs.

%CONDENSED ABOVE FOR SPACE When extracting phrase tables in \secref{sect:extract}, we resorted to pruning the space of possible phrase translations before scoring them, because considering the entire space of phrase pairs is computationally infeasible.  However, relying less on pruning heuristics and being able to consider more pairs is likely to lead to better phrase tables.  Approximate scoring techniques, such as Locality Sensitive Hashing \cite{Charikar2002,VanDurme2010} would enable us to substantially expand the space of candidates we could feasibly consider.

%Named Entities are problematic for MT in general and for our setting in particular, since they tend to have low corpus counts and thus unreliable similarity scores. 

%In addition to proving to be competitive in {\it replacing} elements of the standard phrase-based MT pipeline, we have shown that using features derived from monolingual data to {\it augment} MT systems significantly improves performance. Simply adding our monolingual features to the phrase table results in over a BLEU point performance increase.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Show that simply adding mono features => over a BLEU point gain.
%\item We plan to run this on real data for low resource languages.  We are have been actively collecting newswire data, which we plan to make available to the community.
%\item Language pairs with different writing system: use transliteration for edit distance features (as suggested in \secref{sect:phrasalfeats}).
%\item Showed that augmenting standard pipeline with monolingual features helps.
%\item Demonstrated that monolingual features are informative enough on their own for a competitive system.
%\item Proposed an algorithm for estimating orientation probabilities from monolingual data alone.
%\item Build complete systems for X low-resource languages.
